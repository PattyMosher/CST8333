# CST8333
Project for Programming Language Research Course

This is a simple Python program for data manipulation vi CLI. It utilizes SQLite to perform a few operation (filtering, updating, deleting, etc), and can produce CSV files. 

The course required we start with a CSV file of cheese data, hence the cheezy puns. It's also why it's designed to work with a specific dataset -- it was tightly coupled to the data so the prof could mitigate cheating.
